<h2>Being the Release Manager</h2>

<p>The role of the Release Manager in the Subversion project is to
handle the process of getting code stabilized, packaged and released
to the general public.  If we were building planes, the RM would be
the guy looking at the construction checklists, painting the airline
logo on the fuselage, and delivering the finished unit to the
customer.</p>

<p>As such, there is no real development associated with being an RM.
All the work you have to do is non-coding: coordinating people,
centralizing information, and being the public voice announcing new
stable releases.  A lot of the tasks that the RM has to do are
repetitive, and not automated either because nobody has broken down
and written the tools yet, or because the tasks require human
validation that makes automation a little superfluous.</p>

<p>You may be thinking at this stage that the RM's duty is
unglamorous, and you are kinda right.  If you are looking for a
position within the project that will bring fame and fortune, you're
better off implementing stuff that really needs to be done on trunk.
If you're looking for something that really helps people who don't
care about releases focus on code, then RMing is for you.</p>

<p>So, you are the Release Manager.  What do you need to do?  This is
what the rest of this document is about.</p>

<div class="h2" id="release-branches" title="release-branches">
<h2>Creating and maintaining release branches</h2>

<p>A new release branch is created for each new major and minor
release.  So, for example, a new release branch is created when
preparing to release version 2.0.0, or version 1.3.0.  However, when
preparing to release 1.3.1 (a micro-version increment), the release
branch created for 1.3.0 is used.</p>

<p>If you are preparing for a micro release, then there is no release
branch to create. You just pick up where you left off in the current
minor version release branch.</p>

<p>The time at which a new release branch needs to be created is fuzzy
at best.  Generally, we have a soft schedule of releasing a new minor
version every 6 months.  So, approximately 4 months after the previous
minor release is a good time to start proposing a branch. But remember
that this is flexible, depending on what features are being
developed.</p>

<p>Once people agree that a new release branch should be made, the
Release Manager creates it with the following procedure (substitute
A.B with the version you're preparing, eg. 1.3, or 2.0):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create the new release branch with a server-side copy:</p>
    <pre>
      svn cp http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk \
             http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/A.B.x \
             -m "Create the release branch for release A.B.0."
    </pre></li>

<li><p>Edit <tt>subversion/include/svn_version.h</tt> on trunk and
    increment the version numbers there.  Do not commit these changes
    yet.</p>
    <p>The version number on trunk always reflects the major/minor
    version that will immediately follow the one for which you just
    created a branch (eg. 2.1.0 for the 2.0.x branch, and 1.4.0 for
    the 1.3.x branch).</p></li>

<li><p>Edit <tt>CHANGES</tt> on trunk to introduce a new section for the
    upcoming release.  The section starts with:</p>
    <pre>
      Version A.B.0 (released XX XXXXX 200X, from branches/A.B.x)
      http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/tags/A.B.0
    </pre>
    <p>Leave the release date blank for now. It will remain this way
    until rolling time.</p></li>

<li><p>Commit both these changes with the following log message:</p>
    <pre>
      Increment the trunk version number, and introduce a new CHANGES
      section for the upcoming A.B.0 release.

      * subversion/include/svn_version.h: Increment version number.

      * CHANGES: New section for A.B.0.
    </pre></li>
</ul>

<div class="h2" id="porting-changes" title="porting-changes">
<h2>Porting changes to release branches</h2>

<p>Once a release branch has been created, no development <i>ever</i>
takes place there.  The only changes permitted are ones made to
various bookkeeping files such as <tt>STATUS</tt>, and changes merged
in from trunk.</p>

<p>The protocol used to accept or refuse the merging of changes from
trunk is of interest to all Subversion developers, and as such is
documented in <a
href="hacking.html#release-stabilization">the
release stabilization section of the hacking guide</a>.</p>
